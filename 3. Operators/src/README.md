<b> home_work_3_1 </b><br>
A program that counts 4 numbers from the keyboard and displays the largest of them.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_3_2 </b><br>
A program that will determine and display the entrance and floor if the apartment number is entered from the keyboard. Provided that there is a 9-storey building with 4 entrances, 4 apartments on one floor (Option 1).<br>
<br>
There is a 9-storey building with 4 entrances. The entrance number starts with one. There are 4 apartments on one floor. Write a program that will get the apartment number from the keyboard and display on the screen on which floor, which entrance this apartment is located. If there is no such apartment in this house, then you need to inform the user about it.

<b> home_work_3_3 </b><br>
A program that determines and displays the number of days in a year if the user enters the year from the keyboard.<br>
<br>
Determine the number of days in the year that the user enters. A leap year has 366 days, while a normal year has 365. A leap year is determined by the following rule:<br>
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 without a remainder, but if it is divisible by 100 without a remainder, it is not a leap year. However, if it is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.

<p>
<b> home_work_3_4 </b><br>
A triangle only exists if the sum of any two of its sides is greater than the third. Given a, b, c - the sides of the proposed triangle. The program indicates whether such a triangle exists or not.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_3_5 </b><br>
There is a circle with a center at the origin and a radius of 4. The user enters the x and y coordinates of the point from the keyboard. Write a program that will determine whether this point lies inside the circle or not.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_3_6 </b><br>
A triangle is given with the coordinates of the vertices A(0,0), B(4,4), C(6,1). The user enters x and y coordinates from the keyboard. Write a program that will determine whether this point lies inside the triangle or not.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_3_7 </b><br>
A program that checks if the four-digit number entered by the user on the keyboard is a lucky ticket. The user enters a four-digit number from the keyboard. The program checks if it is a “lucky ticket”.<br>
<br>
Note: a lucky ticket is a number in which - with an even number of digits in the number, the sum of the digits of its left half is equal to the sum of the digits of its right half. For example, consider the number 1322. Its left half is 13 and its right half is 22, and it is the lucky ticket (because 1+3=2+2).
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_3_8 </b><br>
A six-digit number is entered from the keyboard. Check if it is a palindrome (For example, the number 143341).<br>
<br>
Note: A palindrome is a number, word, or text that reads the same from left to right and from right to left. For example, these are the numbers 143341, 5555, 7117, etc.
