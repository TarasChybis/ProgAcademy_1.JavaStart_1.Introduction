<h1> 4. Cycles </h1>
		
<p>
<b> home_work_4_1 </b><br>
With the help of cycles draw “wallpaper”. Moreover, the number of bands must be entered from the keyboard. In the example there are 7 bands.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_4_2 </b><br>
Calculate by loop the factorial of the number “ n ” entered from the keyboard (4<n<16). The factorial of a number is the product of all numbers from that number to 1. For example: 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_4_3 </b><br>
Print the times table for 5. It is preferable to print 1 x 5 = 5, 2 x 5 = 10, not just 5, 10, etc.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_4_4 </b><br>
Display a rectangle from *. Moreover, the height and width of the rectangle are entered from the keyboard. For example, below is a rectangle with a height of 4 and a width of 5.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_4_5 </b><br>
Using a loop (only one) draw an “inverted triangle” shape from *. Moreover, the maximum height of this figure is entered from the keyboard. For example, the maximum height is 4.<br>

<b> home_work_4_6 </b><br>
Use loops to display all prime numbers from 1 to 100 ().<br>
A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 or itself. The first prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7…
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_4_7 </b><br>
Display an "hourglass" whose maximum width is read from the keyboard (odd number). For example, the width is 5.

<b> lesson_4_2 </b><br>
Task: Read from the keyboard 2 variables of type int (a, b). If b>a, then calculate the sum of integers from a to b inclusive.<br>
a = 2, b = 5 => sum = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14<br>
If a <= b, then display an input error message.
