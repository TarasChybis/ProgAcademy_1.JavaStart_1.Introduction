<b> home_work_7_3 </b><br>
Enter a binary number from the console. <br>
Convert it to decimal format and display (“10” -> 2).
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_7_4 </b><br>
Display 10 lines with the value of pi. Moreover, the first line should have 2 decimal places, the second 3, the third 4, etc.

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions where the bits differ.<br>
For example:<br>
	117	= 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1<br>
	17	= 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1<br>
------------------------------------<br>
	H	= 0+1+1+0+0+1+0+0 = 3 - Hamming distance between 117 and 17.<br>
You are given two positive integers (N, M) in decimal form. You need to calculate the Hamming distance between these two numbers.

Vovochka, sitting in the lesson, wrote the same numbers in a row. When Marya Ivanovna took the notebook from him there were several rows of numbers.<br>
Write a program that will determine the minimum number that Vovochka wrote, for example:<br>
11111111=>1<br>
12121212=>12<br>
121121121=>121<br>
