<h1> 6. Methods </h1>
		
<p>
<b> home_work_6_1 </b><br>
Write a method that will return the maximum number from an array of integers.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_6_2 </b><br>
Implement a method whose parameters are an integer, a real number, and a string. It returns the concatenation of a string with the sum of a real and an integer.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_6_3 </b><br>
Implement a method that draws a rectangle of asterisks "*" on the screen - its parameters will be integers that describe the length and width of such a rectangle.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_6_4 </b><br>
Write a method that implements a linear search for an element in an array of integers. If there is such an element in the array, then return its index, if not, then the method should return a number - "-1".
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_6_5 </b><br>
Write a method that will return the number of words in a line of text.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_6_6 </b><br>
There are such sequences of numbers
0,2,4,6,8,10,12     	Arithmetic progression
1,4,7,10,13				Arithmetic progression
1,2,4,8,16,32       	Geometric progression
1,3,9,27				Geometric progression
1,4,9,16,25      		Power series (Степенной ряд)
1,8,27,64,125
Implement a program that will print the next term of this sequence (or similar). For example, the user enters the string 0,2,4,6,8,10,12 the program should answer the number 14. (6 hours)

<p>
<b> home_work_6_7 </b><br>
A palindrome number reads the same on both sides (right to left and left to right). The largest palindrome number obtained by multiplying two two-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 * 99.
Find the largest palindrome obtained by multiplying two three-digit numbers. (4 hours)
